# Pleonastic-It Guidelines

## Task
The overall goal is to identify if a certain occurrence of the pronoun "it" has an antecedent. If it does not then it is likely
an instance of a pleonastic it which will then need to be further classified into four categories.

## Categories
- **Extraposition**: the offset of the subject in a sentence using "it" as a placeholder.
The subject can either be found within a relative clause, infinitive, or gerund.
The best way to make sure it is an instance of this is to replace the "it" with the displaced subject and check to make sure that the sentence still makes sense.
  - It pleases me that you care. => That you care pleases me. Here the clause "that you care" is extraposed and its original position is filled with an "it".
  - It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community. => To look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community is also exciting.
  - It is going to be hard for me to hold back tears. => To hold back tears is going to be hard for me.
  - It is a shame their meeting never took place. => "That" their meeting never took place is a shame.

      - [Extraposition 1] (http://www.germanistika.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/extraposition.pdf) (NOTE TO SELF: only want first part)
      - [Extraposition 2] (http://homepages.uwp.edu/canary/grammar_text/82-extraposed.html)
- **Cleft**: sentence divided into two clauses each with its own verb. 
The best way to identify these is to look for the general pattern *it* + be + X + subordinate clause where X is a word or group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. 
  - It was a pair of gloves with silk embroidery that she bought. In this sentence "a pair of gloves with silk embroidery" is the X.
  - It isn't my interest I am defending. In this sentence "my interest" is the X.
  - Was it Trich who told me she was pregnant?
  - It is Jaime for whom we are looking.
  - No, it is his callousness that I shall ignore.

      - [cleft 2] (http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsACleftSentence.htm)
- **Atmospheric**: instances related to weather, time, distance, or an event which use "it" as the subject
  - Yes, it's that time of the year.
  - Now you know it is the holidays.
- **Idioms**: idiomatic phrases can occasionally use it as the subject 
  - The governor couldnâ€™t make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
